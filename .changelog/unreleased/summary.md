This release is mostly a collection of small fixes and cleanups to make the vault module safer and more consistent. The main feature is a new transaction for updating the vault withdrawal delay, but most changes focus on tightening validation, improving address parsing, and fixing a few edge-case bugs around pricing, swaps, and NAV handling. There are no major behavioral changes, just incremental improvements to correctness and reliability.
