<!--
Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.

Usage:

Change log entries should be added using one of:
1. Our .changelog/add-change.sh script (see: .changelog/README.md#using-add-changesh).
2. The unclog application (see: https://github.com/informalsystems/unclog).
Those will create entry files under the `.changelog/unreleased` directory (in a section/stanza dir).
Examples of adding an entry:
$ .changelog/add-change.sh --issue-no 123 bug-fixes fix-the-thing 'Fix the thing that was broken'
$ unclog add --issue-no 123 --section bug-fixes --id fix-the-thing --message 'Fix the thing that was broken'
Those will create the file .changelog/unreleased/bug-fixes/123-fix-the-thing.md with this content:
`* Fix the thing that was broken [#123](https://github.com/provlabs/vault/issues/123).`
If there is no issue to link to, use the --pull-request flag instead of --issue-no.

If your changes involve updates to go.mod, you should use the `get-dep-changes.sh`
script to generate the dependencies changelog entry, e.g.:
$ scripts/get-dep-changes.sh --issue-no 123 --id bump-the-stuff
That will create the file .changelog/unreleased/dependencies/123-bump-the-stuff with content
generated by analyzing the go.mod file changes.

The content in this CHANGELOG.md file takes precedence over the content of the .changelog directory (in the case of a discrepancy).

Types of changes (Stanzas):

"Features" for new features.
"Improvements" for changes in existing functionality.
"Bug Fixes" for any bug fixes.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Client Breaking" for breaking CLI commands and REST routes used by end-users.
"API Breaking" for breaking exported APIs used by developers building on SDK.
"State Machine Breaking" for any changes that result in a different AppState given same genesisState and txList.
"Dependencies" for changes to library versions.
Ref: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/

Valid --section values are the lower, kebab-case version of the stanza strings, e.g. state-machine-breaking.
You can get an exact list of valid --section values by using the `.changelog/get-valid-sections.sh` script,
or using the `make get-valid-sections` target.
